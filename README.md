# NOMA-uplink-downlink
Iâ€™ve developed simulations in MATLAB and Python that analyze the  outage probability for two users in both NOMA uplink and downlink systems across various SNR levels. The code compares simulated results with theoretical values, highlighting NOMA's efficiency in improving connectivity.
